 
Glacial Force Junior High has to make cuts to its winter athletic budget.  To determine which of the sports could be cut with the least backlash, the director arranges to have $50$ randomly selected parents ask their students their opinion on several school sports.  The data collected is summarized in the two tables below.\\\\
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \multicolumn{6}{c}{\textbf{28 Boys}}\\
 & Love & Like & \pbox{1cm}{Don't\\Care} & Dislike & Hate \\\vspace{-3mm} &&&&&\\ \hline
