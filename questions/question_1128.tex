 
$$A_k=A_0e^{-rk}$$
A simple model for land prices in a city is to presume the city has one center and land values are determined predominantly by distance from that center.  In the equation above, $A_k$ represents the land value per acre, $A_0$ represents the land value of an acre at the city's center, $r$ is a constant ``rate'' of value lost, and $k$ is the distance from the city center in kilometers.  An urban economist wishing to analyze the effectiveness of this model looks at two properties in a given city.  He finds a property at what he is modeling as the city center that has a land value of $\$400,000$ per acre.  $5$ kilometers away from that center he finds a property with a land value of $\$200,000$ per acre.  If these properties are used to generate the model, which of the following is the closest to the value of $r$?
