 
Suppose that the programmer was incorrect in his assumptions, and after one minute the algorithm is only executing $27,000$ calculations per minute.  What should he expect is the true value of $M$, in thousands, based upon this result? (For example, if the answer were $11.88$ thousand, you would grid-in $11.9$)\\ \\
