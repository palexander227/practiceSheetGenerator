In the town of Gogruffy, the city planners designed downtown to have square blocks of equal size, as shown in the map above.  This way they could use the term ``block'' as a uniform measure of distance.  Sumaya wants to establish a deli on an intersection within one block of Long St for customer traffic and within $4$ blocks of the grocery store (\tikz\draw(0,0)node[rectangle,fill=black!30]{G};) as the crow flies just in case she has to go make a quick supply run.  What is the distance, to the nearest whole block, between the most northern and the most southern locations she could use for her deli?\\\\
