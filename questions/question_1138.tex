 
It is not unusual for an elected official to decide either not to endorse any candidate or to make up their mind less than one month before the primary happens in their particular state.  Imagine a candidate that had already received the endorsement of $6$ party-affiliated senators.  Moreover, at this point only $8$ party-affiliated senators, $2$ party-affiliated governors and $5$ representatives have endorsed candidates. How much would a candidate's percentage chance change if he or she received the endorsements of a previously uncommitted senator, a previously uncommitted governor, and three previously uncommitted representatives if no other candidates received endorsements at the same time?\\\\
