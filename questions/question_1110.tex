 
The graph below shows two consumer options for spending $\$30$ on beef and chicken entrees with sides at two different food trucks.  \\\\
\begin{center} \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]\begin{axis}[axis lines=left, xtick={0,4,6}, ytick={0,3,4}, ylabel={Number of Beef Meals}, xlabel={Number of Chicken Meals},axis line style={-}]
