 
The amount of money Maude the magician earns is a fixed commission per member of her audience, but she has to pay $\$200$ to reserve the stage for each performance.  Based upon prior reputation, Maude is allowed to have the stage fee taken from her payout rather than required up front.  During one performance on a slow night, Maude is paid $\$500$ based upon an audience of $140$.  In her budgeting, Maude reserves $18\%$ of her pay for her insurance bills and materials for her tricks that don't count towards her taxable profits.  How much taxable profit will Maude report to the IRS for this performance?
