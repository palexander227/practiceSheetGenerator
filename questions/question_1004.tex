 
Lara is a logistics specialist for a shipping company.  Each week, she receives a shipment that needs to be distributed throughout the entire country.  The number of kilometers left to travel for the last part of the shipment to be offloaded can be estimated  with the equation $d=6000-80t$, where $d$ is the distance left to be traveled and $t$ is the number of hours the shipment has been in transit.  What is the meaning of the value $80$ in this equation?\\
