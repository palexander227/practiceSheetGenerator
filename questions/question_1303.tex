 
A sporting event is nearly sold out, and the only remaining are the corner seats that cost $\$55$ near the away team's reserved seats and the adjacent endzone seats that cost $\$70$.  If George spends at least $\$225$ but no more than $\$400$ on $n$ endzone tickets and $2$ corner seats, what is one possible value of $n$? \\\\
