An aspiring fast food entrepreneur is designing a top for his first kid's meal toy.  The top is comprised of a cylindrical handle which connects to a hemisphere that shares its base with a right cone.  He plans to make the top using the dimensions as marked in the diagram.  His materials cost will be \$0.14 per cubic centimeter.  He wanted to make the tops solid until he discovered how much that would cost per toy, so instead he's hollowed out $80\%$ of the material from the design.  How much, in dollars, will it cost him to make each toy? \\\\
