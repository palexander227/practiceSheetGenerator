 
$$P=0.211G + 1.444$$
The equation above describes a linear correlation between individual European country's military expenditures and their GDPs in 2012.  In the equation, $P$ is the percentage of the country's 2012 GDP devoted to military expenditures and $G$ is the GDP of the country in 2012 measured in trillions of U.S. dollars.  Which of the following statements is true about the model? 


\ifsat
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
		\item The model predicts that military expenditures increase by $1$ percent of GDP per $1.444$ trillion dollars increase in GDP.
		\item The slope of the line represents the predicted increase in GDP per percent increase in military spending.
		\item The $P$-intercept has no meaning.
		\item The model indicates an additional million dollars of GDP has a very small effect on the portion of a European country's budget devoted to military expenditures. %
