 
An elevator has a posted weight limit of $3000$ pounds.  A crew is moving several pieces of industrial equipment with this elevator and realizes they can't put more than $7$ of their lathes in the elevator for any given trip, even though $12$ of their lathes would fit based upon volume.  Based upon this information, which of the following can be determined about the weight of the lathes?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.\hspace{1mm}]
\item The lathes must weigh more than $350$ pounds each.
\item Filling the elevator with all the lathes that would fit would go beyond the weight limit by at least $4800$ pounds.  
\item The speakers can't weigh $450$ pounds or more.
\end{enumerate}
