 
Which of the following statements is the most reasonable inference given the information in the graph?


\ifsat
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
		\item The $y$-intercept indicates the minimum seed yield one should expect from a spatterdock is about $110$ seeds.
		\item There is a strong positive linear correlation between a spatterdock's biomass and the number of seeds produced by the spatterdock. % 
		\item The slope of the line indicates how much spatterdock biomass increases in response to seed production.
		\item The spatterdock is adapted to an environment where lots of herbivores make it important to devote a significant percentage of its metabolism to reproduction.
