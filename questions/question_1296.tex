 
A baker is giving away mini-cupcakes as samples to all the small businesses within $3$ miles of her bakery.  If she gives $5$ mini-cupcakes to each small business, she will have $11$ left over for samples in her shop.  If she wants to give away $6$ mini-cupcakes to each small business, she will need to bake at least $9$ more mini-cupcakes.  How many mini-cupcakes did the baker make for samples?
